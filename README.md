# Analyzing Univeristy Dropout and Academic Performance

## Overview of the Dataset

The dataset includes demographic, academic, and financial information on over 4,000 university students. Key variables include:

- Age at enrollment
- Admission grade
- Gender, marital status, and nationality
- Course and education pathway
- Financial information (tuition payment status, debt status)
- Academic performance (semester grades, dropout/graduation status)

---

## Project Objectives

This analysis is guided by five central research questions:

1. **What student characteristics are most predictive of dropout in the first year?**  
2. **Are there specific courses where dropout rates are the highest?**  
3. **How does students' academic performance in high school or their entry pathway affect their likelihood of graduating on time?**  
4. **Can we segment students into clusters based on dropout likelihood and academic success and tailor interventions accordingly?**  
5. **How do financial variables influence dropout and academic performance?**

## Key Insights

- **Academic performance (admission grades and semester grades)** was more predictive of dropout than demographics such as gender or nationality.
- The **Nursing course had the most graduates**, while **Management (day and evening)** had the highest dropout rates.
- A strong **correlation was found between admission grade and first-semester performance**, reinforcing the value of early academic support.
- **Clustering analysis** revealed student segments based on performance and age, offering opportunities for tailored interventions.
- **Financial difficulties correlated with dropout risk**, but most dropouts still occurred among students who were up to date on tuition, indicating financial support alone is not a cure-all.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Folium, Statsmodels)** for cleaning, exploration, and modeling
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboarding and storytelling
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory and statistical analysis

## Data Ethics & Limitations

- Data is anonymized and used strictly for educational purposes.
- Not all potential dropout predictors are included (e.g., mental health, family support).
- Ethical consideration has been taken to **avoid bias in interpretation**â€”correlation does not imply causation.
- Results should be viewed as **guidance**, not deterministic conclusions.
